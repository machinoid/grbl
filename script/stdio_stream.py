"""\
Simple g-code streaming script for grbl

Provided as an illustration of the basic communication interface
for grbl. When grbl has finished parsing the g-code block, it will
return an 'ok' or 'error' response. When the planner buffer is full,
grbl will not send a response until the planner buffer clears space.

G02/03 arcs are special exceptions, where they inject short line 
segments directly into the planner. So there may not be a response 
from grbl for the duration of the arc.
